# Noah ages through time!

This repository contains the code to create the video...

by Noah Kalina!

## Background info

[Noah Kalina](http://www.noahkalina.com/) took a photo of himself, every day for 20 years, and put them all in a video on youtube! I got aware of his work already back in 2006, when he published his first video covering 6 years. My fascination with this video is due to his dedication to his project, our own wonder about time and getting older.

Please take the time to look at [Noah's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEbk5b9N6IkWbBmeKJb4x2w), and listen to the amazing music from Carly Comando. I can highly recommend the songs "Everyday" and "Circadian".

## How it is done

The visualization in the video was actually done twice:

In my **first attempt**, I took the I actually had two attempts in creating this video. In my first attempt, I took the images directly from Noah's video [Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 20 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAIZ36GI4p8). Applying a data science approach to the video, I've analyzed the images and create this gif:

*Noah ages 20 years in 20 seconds (every image is an average of 6 months).*

**For more details on how I've created this gif, and some other fun things, checkout [this Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/miykael/noah_ages/blob/main/noah_ages.ipynb)!**

After [tweeting about this](https://twitter.com/miyka_el/status/1380061075425652737), Noah contacted me directly, which lead to my **2nd attempt**, the [7777 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC1KHAxE7mo) video and this gif:

![noah_ages_new](noah_average_new.gif)

*Noah ages 21 years in 21 seconds (every image is an average of 2 months).*

The code for doing this can be found in [this Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/miykael/noah_ages/blob/main/noah_ages-video.ipynb).

It's that last notebook that leads to the visualizations:

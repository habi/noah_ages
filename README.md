# How Noah grew up!

This repository contains the code to create the following gif, in which [Noah Kalina](http://www.noahkalina.com/) ages 20 years in 20 seconds (every image is an average of 6 months).

**For more details on how I've created this gif, see [this Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/miykael/noah_ages/blob/main/noah_ages.ipynb)!!!**

## Background info

[Noah Kalina](http://www.noahkalina.com/) took a photo of himself, every day for 20 years, and put them all in a video on youtube! I got aware of his work already back in 2006, when he published his first video covering 6 years. My fascination with this video is due to his dedication to his project, our own wonder about time and getting older, but almost as importantly - because of the captivating and beautiful music in the video, created by the amazing [Carly Comando](http://www.carlycomandomusic.com/).

The video on which the gif above is based on, is this one (click the video to get to the youtube video):

Please take the time to look at the video, and listen to the amazing music from Carly Comando. I can highly recommend the songs "Everyday" and "Circadian".

## How it is done
